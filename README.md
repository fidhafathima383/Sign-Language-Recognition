# Sign-Language-Recognition
This project builds a system to recognize and translate sign language gestures into readable text using computer vision and machine learning. It processes images or videos of hand gestures to map them to sign language meanings, aiming to bridge the communication gap for individuals with hearing or speech impairments.
